# Preprocessing steps

## 1) Anomely detection 
Anomaly detection is the process of discover the event or the points which are unexpected at this position of the dataset or deviates from the normal pattern of the dataset. 
So, the detection of those points very important; because it give us an early step to make the emergency movements to control that un usual change.
We have worked on several methods Like:
- Tokey's Box Plot:
- Isolation Forest Method:
- LSTM Autoencoders Method:
- Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Method:

## 2) Missing data imputation models
We have several methods to impute time series data
- Conventional methods:
  - Ignore or deletion.
  - Mean imputation.
  - Mode imputation.
  - Median imputation.
- Imputation procedure:
  - Last valid observation forward.
  - Next valid observation forward.
  - Interpolation.
- Learnable methods:
  - KNN algorithm.
  - AutoRegressive.
  - Genitic algorithm.
  - MICE algorithm.
  - Least square SVM.
  - GAIN.
  - Conv-GAIN.
