# Preprocessing steps
------
## 1) Anomely detection 


## 2) Missing data imputation models
We have several methods to impute time series data
- Conventional methods:
  - Ignore or deletion.
  - Mean imputation.
  - Mode imputation.
  - Median imputation.
- Imputation procedure:
  - Last valid observation forward.
  - Next valid observation forward.
  - Interpolation.
- Learnable methods:
  - KNN algorithm.
  - AutoRegressive.
  - Genitic algorithm.
  - MICE algorithm.
  - Least square SVM.
  - GAIN.
  - Conv-GAIN.
